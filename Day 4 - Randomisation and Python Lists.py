# # Python lists
# # lists can contain any type of data
# # it is also important to note that lists have orders and the other is not lost when the list is stored in a variable
#
# fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'pawpaw', 'cucumber', 'date', 'coconut']
#
# print(fruits[0])
#
# # you can have positive or negative index
#
# fruits[1] = 'oranjen'
#
# # you can also select an item in the list and change it
#
# fruits.append('cashew')
#
# # using the append function, we can add an item to the end of our list.
#
# # if you have more than one item, you can use the extend function. See below
#
# fruits.extend(['mango', 'pineapple'])
#
# # you can also nest a list into another list
#
# EPL = ['Chelsea', 'Arsenal', 'City', 'ManUTD', 'Brighton']
# Championship = ['Ipswich', 'Leicester' 'Coventry']
#
# english_football_clubs = [EPL, Championship]
#
# print(english_football_clubs)

# the result of the above is nesting the two strings inside each other.
