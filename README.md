# 100daysofpython
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge journey where I'm diving into the world of Python! 🚀

**ABOUT**

This repository is my personal space where I am committing to the 100 Days of Code challenge. Over the next 100 days, I will be dedicating time every day to learning and coding in Python. Whether it is solving problems, building projects, or exploring new concepts, each day will be a step forward in my journey.

**Why Python?**

I discovered that knowledge of a scripting language is desirable by most recruiters. In addition, knowledge of a scripting language helps automate mundane aspects of a job freeing up time to do actual complex stuff. In a bid to become more valuable and further my chances of getting a job, I have decided to learn a scripting language, python. Python is a very versatile language with a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis, machine learning, etc.

**Goals** 

Consistency: I hope to code every day for the next 100 days, no excuses! It would be difficult though as I have my final semester exams coming up very soon and I am concurrently writing my final year thesis. But I hope to do it regardless. Edit: couldn't do it while writing my exams and thesis because school is also very important 😮‍💨


Learning: Dive deep into Python fundamentals and advanced topics.


Projects: Work on coding projects to apply and reinforce what I learn. 


**Happy coding! 💻✨**
