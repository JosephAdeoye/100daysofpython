# 100daysofpython
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge journey where I'm diving into the world of Python! ðŸš€

**ABOUT**
This repository is my personal space where I am committing to the 100 Days of Code challenge. Over the next 100 days, I wll be dedicating time every day to learn and code in Python. Whether it is solving problems, building projects, or exploring new concepts, each day will be a step forward in my journey.

**Why Python?**
In my search for a job in cybersecurity, I learnt that knowledge of a scripting language is desirable by most recruiters. In a bid to further my chances of getting a job, I have decided to learn a scripting language, python. Python is a very versatile language with a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis, machine learning, etc.

**Goals** 
Consistency: I hope to code every day for the next 100 days, no excuses! It will be very difficult though as I have my final semester exams coming up very soon and I am concurrently writting my finaly year thesis. But I hope to do it regardless. 
Learning: Dive deep into Python fundamentals and advanced topics.
Projects: Work on coding projects to apply and reinforce what I learn. 

Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
