print("Hello!\nI am Adeoye Joseph")

# The \n above pushes the string that comes after to the next line.

# The above is an example of string concatenation

input('What is your name?')

# The input function allows us to take in information

len(input("Enter your name "))

# The len function allows to get the number of text in a string.

# in line 18, we stored the input of the function in the name variable
# in line 19, we concatenated the string "His name is" with the value of the name variable.
